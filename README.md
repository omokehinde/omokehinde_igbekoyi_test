<h3>Question A </h3>
The <b>overlap.py</b> module contains my solution to this question:<br/>
by calling the method overlap(arg1,arg2) passing the 2 points as arguements would 
return <b>True</b> if the points overlap and <b>False</b> otherwise.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Question B</h3>
The <b>checkVersion.py</b> contains my solution to this question:
The method is self explanatory. if you pass in a wrong arguement it 
displays a <i>(error)</i> message that tells you what to do.

<h3>Question B</h3>
